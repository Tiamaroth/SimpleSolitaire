# Unity3D Solitaire

Hi to all, this small project was originally made with unity __5.6.1f1__ version, so it will give you a fair amount of warnings if you use one of the latest release, but it will still compile and run.

It is a sample Solitaire game that I made for an interview challenge a few years ago (mid 2016 i think) and I decided to share it.

Hope that you enjoy it and do not hesitate to contact me to ask questions :)
